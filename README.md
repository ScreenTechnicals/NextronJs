## üçÅ Nextron (Electron + Next)

Nextron is basically a electron based web app which wraps Next Js, so that we can use Next Js and it's features inside Electron Js.

### How To Use Next Js 13

So basically the nextron package does not have next js 13 configuration by default, so to sort that I have created this Nextron template for Next Js 13.

Currently it only supports pages router.

### How To Use ?

Simply run this command in your terminal and you are good to go üöÄ.

```
git clone https://github.com/ScreenTechnicals/NextronJs.git
```
